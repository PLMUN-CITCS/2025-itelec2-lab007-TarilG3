### **Step 1.1: Accept the Assignment**

   1. Click on the assignment link provided by your instructor.
   2. GitHub Classroom will create a **private repository** under your GitHub account.
   3. After the repository is created, click **"Go to Repository"** to view your assignment.

---

### **Step 1.2: Setup your Git Environment**
Only perform this if this is the first time you will setup your Git Environment

   1. Create a GitHub Account:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/signup?source=login
   ```
      
   2. Download and Install Git on your Laptop/Desktop:
   ```bash
   https://git-scm.com/downloads
   ```
   
   3. Create a Folder in your Laptop/Desktop
   4. Right-click anywhere in the created folder and select "Open Git Bash Here".
   5. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git name, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   6. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git email, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   
   7. Create your SSH Key, just follow the instructions, no need to provide filename and passphrase. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   
   8. Copy your SSH Keys into clipboard. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:

   11. In the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
   12. Click the New SSH key button.
   13. In the Title field, give the key a recognizable name (e.g., "My Windows Laptop").
   14. In the Key field, CTRL + V or paste the keys copied into your clipboard. Save the key.
   15. Go Back to terminal, use command:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**

   1. On your repository page, click the green **"Code"** button.
   2. Copy the repository URL (choose HTTPS for simplicity).
   3. Open your terminal (or Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell) and run:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <git_repo_url>
   ```
   
   4. Navigate into the cloned folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd <git_cloned_folder>
   ```

### **Step 3: Complete the Assignment**

**Exercise # 05 - Combined Application Exercise in Python**

   **Objective:**
   This exercise combines the concepts of variables, input/output, arithmetic operators, and the math library to create a more comprehensive program.  You will learn to:
   - Get numerical input from the user.
   - Perform arithmetic operations on the input.
   - Use the math library for more advanced calculations (square root and sine).
   - Display the results in a clear and formatted way.
   - Handle a potential error (negative input for square root).

   **Desired Output:**
   ```bash
   Enter a number to perform operations on: 
   Arithmetic Operations:
   User number + 10 = 35.00
   User number - 5  = 20.00
   User number * 2  = 50.00
   User number / 3  = 8.33

   Math Library Functions:
   Square root of 25.00 is: 5.0
   Sine of 25.00 degrees is: 0.4226
   ```
      
   **Notable Observations (to be discussed after completing the exercise):**
   - This exercise demonstrates how to combine different programming concepts to build a more functional program.
   - It reinforces the importance of data type conversion (using float() in this case).
   - It shows how to use the math library for more advanced mathematical operations.
   - It introduces basic error handling (checking for negative input before calculating the square root).
   - It emphasizes the importance of clear and formatted output.
   - It uses f-strings for cleaner and more readable formatting.

   **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

   1. Setting up: Open your preferred Python environment or Text Editor, and create a Python Script.
      - Required Filename: `exercise_05.py`
      
   2.  Get numerical input:
      - Use the input() function to prompt the user to enter a number. Store the input in a variable named user_number.
      - Crucially, convert the input string to a float using the float() function. This allows you to work with decimal numbers.
```python
user_number = float(input("Enter a number to perform operations on: "))
```
      
   3.  Perform arithmetic operations:
      - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on user_number. Store the results in appropriately named variables (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
```python
addition = user_number + 10
subtraction = user_number - 5
multiplication = user_number * 2
division = user_number / 3
```

   4. Use math library functions:
      - Import the math module if you haven't already done so at the top of your file.
      - Calculate the square root of user_number. However, check if user_number is negative. The square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system. If it's negative, store an appropriate message (e.g., "Undefined for negative numbers") in the sqrt_value variable. Otherwise, calculate and store the square root.
      - Calculate the sine of user_number. Assume the user is entering the angle in degrees. Use math.radians() to convert it to radians before using math.sin().
```python
import math # Import math module (only need to do this once at the top in a real script)
sqrt_value = math.sqrt(user_number) if user_number >= 0 else "Undefined for negative numbers"
sine_value = math.sin(math.radians(user_number))  # Assuming user enters an angle in degrees
```

   5. Display the results with formatted output (using f-strings):
      - Use print() and f-strings to display the results of the arithmetic operations and the math functions. Format the output to two decimal places using .2f.
```python
print("\nArithmetic Operations:")
print(f"User number + 10 = {addition:.2f}")
print(f"User number - 5  = {subtraction:.2f}")
print(f"User number * 2  = {multiplication:.2f}")
print(f"User number / 3  = {division:.2f}")

print("\nMath Library Functions:")
print(f"Square root of {user_number:.2f} is: {sqrt_value}")
print(f"Sine of {user_number:.2f} degrees is: {sine_value:.4f}") # Sine formatted to 4 decimal places
```

   6. Run the code: Execute your Python code.
   7. Observe the output: Compare your output with the "Desired Output" shown above.
   8. Discussion (Notable Observations):
      - How does this exercise combine the concepts you've learned in previous exercises?
      - Why is it important to convert the user input to a float?
      - Explain how the conditional expression (if user_number >= 0 else ...) is used to handle the error when calculating the square root of a negative number.
      - Why is it important to format the output? How do f-strings make formatting easier?
      - What other error handling techniques could you use? (Hint: try-except blocks)

### **Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub**
Once you've completed your changes, follow these steps to upload your work to your GitHub repository.

1. Check the status of your changes:
   Open the terminal and run:
   
```bash
git status
```
   This command shows any modified or new files.
   
2. Stage the changes:
   Add all modified files to staging:
   
```bash
git add .
```
   
3. Commit your changes:
   Write a meaningful commit message:
   
```bash
git commit -m "Submitting Python Week 02 - Session 01 - Exercise 05"
```
   
4. Push your changes to GitHub:
   Upload your changes to your remote repository:
   
```bash
git push origin main
```
